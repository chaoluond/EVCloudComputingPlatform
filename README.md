# EVCloudComputingPlatform

1. Studied algorithms for EV charging stations placement and real-time dynamic pricing.

2. Developed a software for EV charging station management, including data acquisition, machine learning and prediction, mathematical optimization, and real time decision making. Multithreading and parallel computing techniques are used for speed boost.

3. If you have any questions or concerns for this project, please feel free to contact the Chao Luo at cluo1@nd.edu.
